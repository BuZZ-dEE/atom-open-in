# Open In {app}

A package for opening your project in a git client.

To use it, open the Command Palette `cmd+shift+P` and write `open in` or `github`for example to get the command for it.

To remove the command for an application you don't use, go to the settings and uncheck it.

Currently support for the `GitHub` and `SourceTree` apps, but if you like it and want support for any other app, let me know :)
